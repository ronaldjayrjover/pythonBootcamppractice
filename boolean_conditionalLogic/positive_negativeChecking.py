###to see the value of the x and y
print(x)
print(y)

####because i did not read the complete instructions
### the number is random so i configured in my code an input
if x > 0 and y > 0:
    print("both positive")
elif x < 0 and y < 0:
    print("both negative")
elif x > 0 and y < 0:
    print("x is positive and y is negative")
else:
    print("x is negative and y is positive")
